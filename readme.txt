A simple, fast admin table to actually manage your MailPoet subscribers. Because apparently filtering by custom field is a premium feature in 2026.

== Description ==

MailPoet is a fine newsletter plugin. Really. But if you've ever tried to filter 50,000 subscribers by a custom field, sort them, or bulk-tag a selection — you know the pain. The built-in UI doesn't do it. The premium plan doesn't do it either. So here we are, writing a free plugin to add what should have been a checkbox in settings.

**DC MailPoet Manager** gives you one clean admin page under **Tools → MailPoet Manager** that does exactly what you'd expect a subscriber manager to do:

* **Filter by any custom field** — pick which columns to display, filter NPA by exact match or range
* **Filter by tags and lists** — ANY or ALL mode, because nuance matters
* **Filter by status** — subscribed, unsubscribed, bounced, inactive, unconfirmed
* **Search** — across email, first name, and last name. Groundbreaking, we know
* **Sort** — click a column header. Yes, that's it. It just works
* **Bulk actions** — add/remove tags, add/remove lists, unsubscribe, export CSV
* **50k+ subscribers?** — server-side pagination, no browser meltdown
* **CSV export** — select rows, export. No third-party service, no upsell

One PHP file. One JS file. One CSS file. No React. No npm. No build step. No subscription required.

**Full disclosure:** This plugin was built entirely with AI. Every line of PHP, JS, and CSS was generated by a machine that has never once had to deal with a MailPoet support ticket. It is provided as-is, with absolutely no warranty. If it breaks your site, your newsletter, or your will to live — you were warned.
